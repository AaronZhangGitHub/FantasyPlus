What is this?
------

Adds weekly projected points, rankings, standard deviations, and injury-adjusted averages from Fantasypros.com (CBS, ESPN, NumberFire, FFToday, Pro FootballFocus) and FantasySharks (for D/ST and IDP) to fantasy sites. The numbers are customized for your league settings (so PPR, for example, is automatically added in). It looks like this:

And supports IDP's as well (which ESPN does not project at all).

Future Ideas
------
* Support Yahoo, NFL, and Fleaflicker
* Give the option to select which experts you want
* Add more projected sources, especially for defense

Known Issues
------
* Some esoteric scoring settings are not currently monitored ("2 points for the first 10 yards if your name starts with a J")
* FantasyPros doesn't have return yardage, which can be pretty valuable
